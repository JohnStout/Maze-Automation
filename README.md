# Maze-Automation
I wrote code to interface with an automated maze build by maze engineers and assembled by myself with the help of some lab mates.

Arduino code is not designed to interface with the maze-engineers code, but instead was used to work with a hand-crafted maze built by Jamie Quesenberry at UD with mechanical components put together by me
